            If 3 words were used to define his character and personality, it would be competitive, curious, 
            and charisma. Yes... the 3 C's... <br><br>Peter has traveled to 12 different countries and has lived in 
            8 different states in America. He is fluent in both Korean and English. But he can also say about 5 important
            sentences in 4 other languages.<br><br>Peter is also a musician. He had a music album out in his early 20's 
            as an r&b artist. Now he works at a music publishing company located in New York as head of the A&R department.
